# Tic Tac Toe Game 

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" in Python. It allows two players to take turns and play the game until there is a winner or a draw.

1. The game will display the Tic Tac Toe board and prompt you to enter your moves. 
Players can input their moves by specifying the square in the board.
2. Alternate between the two players until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
